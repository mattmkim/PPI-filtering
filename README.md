# PPI-filtering 
## Overview

Goals of research were to develop a new method for clustering atoms on proteins and to improve the accuracy of protein-protein interface predictions. Clustering was dependent on both the positions of atoms and their susceptibility to dewetting in the presence of an unfavorable potential. Two approaches were taken for the filtering problem - a naive approach that utilized clustering, as well as a more comprehensive approach that utilized neural networks.
